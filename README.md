# ASCII-CONVERT
## What is it
An Image to ASCII converter capable of turning images (.bmp, .png, .jpg, etc.) into ASCII characters. Can convert in 1:1 and 2 to 1 modes.

### What's the difference between 1:1 and 2:1?
When we convert an image to ASCII 1:1, the output looks a bit vertically stretched because in fonts characters are always 2 times longer in hight comparing to width. And in 1:1 mode, every pixel from the image is mapped to a single ASCII character, while in 2:1, every 2 pixels (taken vertically) are mapped to a single character, making the output look natural.

## Usage
```bash
./ascii-convert [INPUT FILE] [COLOR MODE] [GRADIENT LENGTH] [ENABLE 2:1] [OUTPUT FILE]
```
`COLOR MODE` - either `l`(light) or `d`(dark)

`GRADIENT LENGTH` - by default, the gradient is 10 characters long: `" .:-=+*#%@"` you can reduce it,if you want!

`ENABLE 2:1` - `0` or `1`

`OUTPUT FILE` - not specifying will result in output to console

### Demonstration (light color mode, 9 length, 2:1)
